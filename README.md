# NuvolaPlayer_Arch
Arch PKGBUILDS for Nuvolaplayer
===================


In this repo are PKGBUILDS of the latest (2017-09-21) NuvolaPlayer Runtimes/libs/Apps

----------


Download the pkgbuilds
-------------

 **Required for the runtime** Diorite

 **Required for apps** Nuvolasdk


I suggest installing the above first. They are located in the libs folder

Then install the runtime in the runtime folder

Then install applications that you desire. All packages build. But i only verify **youtube** and **google play music**

Update Frequency
-------------

I have setup build scripts that run every friday starting at 3AM MST/MDT. any updates should show by Friday MST/MDT 6-7AM

I will be posting these scripts soon (they are very static in nature)

I will also be looking into creating a REPO for distrubiting built packages in the future in my free time (I have this installed on 4 devices so for me a compile once and install quad would be awesome)
