Arch PKGBUILDS for Nuvolaplayer
===================


In this repo are PKGBUILDS of the latest (2017-09-21) NuvolaPlayer Runtimes/libs/Apps

----------


Download the pkgbuilds
-------------

 **Required for the runtime** Diorite
 **Required for apps** Nuvolasdk
I suggest installing the above first. They are located in the libs folder

Then install the runtime in the runtime folder

Then install applications that you desire. All packages build. But i only verify **youtube** and **google play music**
